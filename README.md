# Cocktail Maniacs

A website that is menu of a cocktail restaurant.

We make cocktails with ingredients that aren't seen elsewhere.

My site URL: https://chandan151.github.io/Cocktail-Maniacs/

documentations and details of API: https://wizard-world-api.herokuapp.com/swagger/index.html

I used two APIs in my website.

1. https://wizard-world-api.herokuapp.com/Houses

2. https://wizard-world-api.herokuapp.com/Elixirs

Description: I am using API to get data on Harry Potter books, specifically Elixirs and School Houses. then I intended to make a website that is kind of a business website for a cocktail restaurant. In the restaurant, all elixirs are represented as magical cocktails with their unique ingredients. after that, I used data from houses API to make a DOM that prints the location of the store and its details.
